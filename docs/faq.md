**What is infinity node?**
Infinity nodes is Sinovate custom code servers based on masternodes idea. The features and economically difference is huge.

**What does the infinity node actually do?**
Infinity nodes provides blockchain with calculations, security checks, sync data for peers, and other servers features. 

**Do i need to keep computer on to keep the wallet running and receive the rewards?**
You start Infinity node server with you own hosted server or simply use "1click in-wallet" hosting and that's all, no need to run wallet or keep opened.

**Do Sinovate blockchain have nodes limit?**
Nodes limit is more like ROI limit, unique Sinovate "Burn" system lovers nodes count every year, less nodes - more ROI. You can see next nodes expired time from the Explorer.

**What is ROI?**
Return on Investment.
is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. 
ROI tries to directly measure the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost.

**What is Burn system?**
Sinovate Burn means Infinity nodes collateral (1 000 000 SIN coins for example) Burned in exchange "BurnTx". No one can use them after Burn, you also can see total burned amount from the Explorer.
With this "BurnTx" you'll have, you can start Infinity node and they will provide you with rewards every X blocks (every day), rewards is burned coins + more, in 1 year time limit. 
"BurnTx" limited with 1 year, this very unique burn system very good fight with inflation. Investor cant sell all at any time like masternodes, nothing to sell - collateral burned.

**Why my node dont have rewards or blocks count stuck, stoped?**
The nodes made to protect blockchain, every day hackers trying to attack chain, every day we fix and improve code. If your server are fine, posible node just need restart or re-sync. A lot Wallets updates already released and more to come.

**My node are fine but i dont have rewards !**
Please make sure your wallet are latest version and actual block count, you simply don't see rewards.
